# [UNMAINTAINED] Clojure API for Selenium-WebDriver #

This is a Clojure library for driving a web browser using Selenium-WebDriver.

You **must** add the Selenium-WebDriver JAR's you need explicitly in your project's dependencies. This library _does not_ ship with runtime dependencies on any version of Selenium-WebDriver to allow compatibility with Selenium-WebDriver's upstream releases.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver/wiki) for prose documentation or generate API docs using `lein doc` inside this project.

**Please join the Google group if you use this library.** I regularly post announcements about upcoming releases, and although I ensure all tests are passing and try to maintain good test coverage before releases, user testing is invaluable. Thank you!

## Contributing ##

The `master` branch of clj-webdriver houses code intended for the next **minor-version release.** If you want to propose new features for the next release, you're welcome to fork, make a topic branch and issue a pull request against the `master` branch.

If you want to fix a bug in the **current release**, please pull against the appropriate branch for the current minor version, **0.7.x**.

## Running Tests ##

To run the default suite:

```
lein test
```

To run the test suite for an existing hub/node setup:

```
./script/grid-hub start
./script/grid-node start
lein test :manual-setup
```

To run the test suite for Saucelabs, first visit the [test app on Heroku](http://vast-brushlands-4998.herokuapp.com) to make sure it's "awake" and then run:

```
lein test :saucelabs
```

## Release ##

There's a Ruby script at `script/release`. It was written using version 2.2.2, no promises that it works with any other.

```
./script/release --release-version 8.8.8 --new-version 9.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

The `--release-version` can be `-r` and the `--new-version` can be `-n`. Further, the new version must end with `-SNAPSHOT`.
